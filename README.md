The way this works is you get a FEN string fed into your program from STDIN as your input and you have a budget of 5 billion instructions to print out your next move in UCI format to STDOUT. You don't have access to the network, files or other cores so try and implement the smartest chess bot in the fewest amount of instructions possible!
